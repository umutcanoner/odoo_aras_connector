# Odoo ARAS Connector

## Project Description

The Odoo ARAS Connector is an Odoo module designed to integrate Odoo with the ARAS Innovator PLM system. This module provides a seamless connection between the two systems, allowing data to be shared and synchronized.

## Installation Instructions

1. Ensure that you have Odoo version 13.0 or later installed.
2. Download the Odoo ARAS Connector module.
3. Place the module in the addons directory of your Odoo installation.
4. Update the module list in Odoo.
5. Install the module through the Odoo interface.

## Examples

To use the Odoo ARAS Connector, you first need to configure the connection to your ARAS Innovator system. This can be done in the settings of the module.

Once the connection is configured, you can start synchronizing data between Odoo and ARAS. The module provides models for common ARAS data types, such as Parts and Documents.

For example, to synchronize a Part from ARAS to Odoo, you would use the `aras_part` model:

```python
part = self.env['aras.part'].search([('aras_id', '=', 'PART-00001')])
part.synchronize()
```

This will fetch the data for the part from ARAS and update the corresponding record in Odoo.
